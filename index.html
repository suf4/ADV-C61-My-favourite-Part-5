It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction.It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.Through books reading nobody can feel alone and disturb. I think this habit is more precious than gold or other precious stones of the world. It provides us high level of knowledge, noble thoughts and ideas to work in many fields. Good and interesting books are like best friends of the one who like to read. The one who do not have this habit may possess worldly wealth but he/she would always be poor because of the lack of wealth of true knowledge. The habit of reading books can be acquired at young age by anyone.Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete.

Whenever I go home from school, after completing my homework, I like to read books like this. I am 12 years old and studying in class 7.Now, I know it well, that reading books is a very good habit, which makes me perfect. This hobby can be developed by anyone, however, I have found it naturally. Reading books keeps a person happy and busy. It is a good source of pleasure, knowledge, encouragement and information. This makes us a successful person with discipline, just, reliable, punctual and even more important.No person can remain alone and disturbed by reading books. I believe that this habit is more valuable than gold in the world. It gives us a high level of knowledge, ideal ideas, good thinking, etc. to work in various fields. For those who are fond of reading books, good and full of interest is like a good friend.One who does not have this habit, no matter how many worldly things and wealth he possesses, is still poor due to lack of true wealth of knowledge. The habit of reading a book or a hobby can be attained by anyone trying even at a young age.Books are my ultimate friend. I like spending time with them. Whether it is a mood to increase knowledge or entertainment – they are always available. Read as much as you want, when you want, read whatever you want. No limits, limitless topics, unlimited availability. Reading fiction stories, jokes, novels, dramas, biographies, travel stories are all interesting and informative to humans. Books are our best friends, it never deceives us.Books never allow the feeling of loneliness. But a caution about the books is necessary. According to our age, we should study only useful books on appropriate subjects.

        <h1>Dr.Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar ; 14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956), also known as Babasaheb Ambedkar , was an Indian polymath - philosopher, jurist, economist, politician, social reformer, journalist, writer, sociologist, and anthropologist. He inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement and campaigned against social discrimination towards the untouchables . He was British India's Minister of Labour in Viceroy's Executive Council, Chairman of the Constituent Drafting committee, independent India's first Minister of Law and Justice, and considered the chief architect of the Constitution of India.Ambedkar was a prolific student, earning doctorates in economics from both Columbia University and the London School of Economics, gaining reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics and political science. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred upon Ambedkar. Ambedkar's legacy includes numerous memorials and depictions in popular culture.Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar) in the Central Provinces (now in Madhya Pradesh). He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar. His family was of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe (Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra. Ambedkar was born into a Mahar (dalit) caste, who were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination. Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the British East India Company, and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment. Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as "No peon, No Water". He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he had to take home with him.Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to Satara two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons – Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao – and two daughters – Manjula and Tulasa – of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school. His original surname was Sakpal but his father registered his name as Ambadawekar in school, meaning he comes from his native village 'Ambadawe' in Ratnagiri district. His Devrukhe Brahmin teacher, Krishnaji Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from 'Ambadawekar' to his own surname 'Ambedkar' in school records.
